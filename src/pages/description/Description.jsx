                <p className="itemText">I have played anime quizzes before with friends, and it was a great experience for the most part. I wanted to reproduce that experience but for a solo player. I don't think it is as fun as I wanted it to be, and well the questions are kind of hard, but using trivia api to generate the questions was the most obvious choice here as it just provided so much benefits, and allowed me to focus on other things.

                <p className="itemText">Side note: Watch Lupin, it's great</p>
